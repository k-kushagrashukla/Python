# Python üêç
- Python  is an interactive , interpreted , object-oriented programming  language
- It is a high level programming language
- Initially designed by Sir Guido Van Rossum in 1991
## Careers in Python
- Software Engineer
- Python Developer
- Research Analyst
- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer
## Advantages and Disadvantages of Python
*Advantages*
- Presence of third party modules
- open source , easy to use , user friendly
- high language
- portable, interactive, highly efficient
- Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data types based on the value assigned, it takes data type.

*Disadvantages*
- Speed is slow because it is an interpreted language ,because of which code executed line by line.
- Python is an weak language for mobile development
- Python memory consumption is also too much high
## Compiler VS Interpreter
*compiler*
- The compiler scans the whole program in one go
- As it scans the code in one go, the errors are going to shown in the end
- the main advantage of compiler is it's execution time
- it converts source code into object code
- it is more efficient

*Interpreter*
- Translates the program one statement at a time
- errors are shown line by line not like compiler at end
- Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code,it is preferred less
- It does not convert source code to object code
- It is less efficient
## IDLE (Integrated devlopment and Learning Environment)
- Python IDLE offers full-fledged file editor, which gives you the ability to write and execute python program from with in this program
- It allows programmers to easily write python code just like python shell, Idle can be used to cexecute a single statement and create , modify and execute python scripts
## IDE (Integrate Devlopment Environment)
- IDE Provides an Environment consolidated for the programmer to write a computer program
- Bascially IDE is an environment or combination of tools , jahan par aap code likhte ho apna
## REPL ( Read Evaluate Print Loop )
REPL is the interactive top level of programming language interpreter or command line shell. It offers the user a simple prompt , accepts expressions , evaluate them and print the result.
## Variables
Pyton variables can be only start with (A-Z/a-z) or underscore(_)
```python
Niharika=100
_lives='kanpur'
_lives
output='kanpur'
```
Python is an case-sensitive programming language , so python identifiers Name and name are two different things
```python
name='shradhha ji'
name
output='shradhha ji'
```
You can aslso assign multiple values to python varaibles in one statement.
```python
age,city=20,'kanpur'
print(age,city)
output=20 kanpur
```
We can also delete python variables using the keyword 'del'
```python
a='black'
dela
a
Name Error: name 'a' is not defined
```
# Python Datatype
- Datatype represent a type of data present inside a variable
Python Conatin following inbuilt data types :-
1) Int
2) Float
3) Complex
4) boal
5) str
6) bytes
7) bytearray
8) range
9) list
10) tuple
11) set
12) fozenset
13) dict
14) None
